   "description": "There is water constantly flowing out of the ground on the alley east of 213 E. Cottage Grove about 40 feet north of the street. The water is bubbling up and flowing south to the street then flowing east to Lincoln. When it was cold recently a glacier formed there that was dangerous to walk or drive on. It i now getting swampy there - still dangerous but in a different way. Both City Utilities and property owner were notified, but it is not clear if anyone has determined where the water is coming from. Good to check the meters in the area, e.g., 701 N. Lincoln, 700 N. Washington, 706 N. Washington for any unexpectedly high usage.",

   "description": "We live just a few blocks north of Bryan Park.  At 4:09AM Saturday, Jan 15 my family was woken to what sounded like 8 gunshots, followed by two more a few minutes later.  These noises sounded like they originated only a couple blocks south.  Then there were 2 more shots (much fainter) at about 4:19AM.  I never heard any sirens.  Anyone have any insight into this occurrence?\n \nWhat is going to be done about the current state of affairs in regards to violence and drugs in the city of Bloomington?  \n\nMy wife and I have been increasingly concerned with the general state of \"health\" in Bloomington for the last few years.  We have had random weapon-bearing tweekers and would-be thieves wander/stumble into our yards and onto our porches, we have had packages stolen from porches and mailboxes, we have had items stolen from our vehicles and property.  My wife even witnessed a man masturbating in public!  We now have cameras set up on our property to monitor 24/7 and I have a baseball bat next to my bed that I have already had to use once to run off a potential thief.  We are two productive members of the community who pay our taxes and contribute to the local economy.  But, we are considering moving due to the eroding quality of Bloomington.  We know many others who feel the same way.  \n\nIn the last week alone we have heard of at least one stabbing death and one gunshot death.  And upon a bit of reading of the Bloomingtonian it appears that Bloomington is doing rather poorly overall in this category.   According to BPD Chief Mike Diekhoof, from a March 2023 article in the Bloomingtonian, in 2022 in Bloomington a gun crime \noccurred every 2.77 days.  And someone shot at someone else every 5.2 days!  And this is an upward moving trend.  What the hell is going on here!?  The previous mayor seemed to care little about this.  Is the new mayor working with you to do something about all this?  What do you plan to do about it?\n\nthanks.\nIan Miller",

However, this expansion has been presented as for the move of administrative staff members. Does the director of CBU operate street sweepers or am I missing something? This seems like a response that is not inclusive. I think the community is well aware that the police force also has special equipment including but not limited to the bear cat vehicle, however it seems the plan is to move police into the central city hall location. Not sure how this plan matches up with the promise to consider all opinions, views, community members, and is certainly not mindful or inclusive of all city departments.",

   "description": "Just spoke with the county regarding issues in the ROW, blocked sidewalks, etc. (items that citizens can report and get addressed more easily within city limits, but again the city is within the county). Their stance was that any items (not within city limits) are items that only the police/sheriff would enforce. This is not how code is laid out and seems to be not the legal process in place. Can we get someone in the city to have conversations with the county on behalf of county tax payers, as Bloomington residents or even visitors for that matter are within Monroe county as well? There continues to be a deficit in response to daily issues, a default of finger pointing to other departments or endless transfers to be told only police will do anything if they have time. This is very frustrating as there continues to be no system, such a uReport, within the County to get items addressed more easily. Instead they want to continue to require account creation for them to obtain your data or require in person visits. Citizens need help with the county to improve our experience and quality of life in Monroe County. Please help facilitate this as it is going unchanged even with what limited contact citizens can make to them. Thank you!",

When someone is walking south on Forrest on the west side of the street, the person must walk in a grassy area that looks a bit like a sidewalk from a distance, though it is only grass. When that person gets to the intersection with 10th Street, there is a drop-off of about 4 inches to the 10th Street sidewalk that is unexpected and jarring. Perhaps a little ramp there would improve the situation, though the addition of a sidewalk along Forrest would be a more ideal remedy. It is not clear if this is a City or a Campus issue, so please forward if this request should be sent to IU instead.",

Unfortunately, I could not find any information on the website regarding the required level of fill for bin collection. Furthermore, the representative I spoke to on the phone in early December acknowledged the need for emptying but continued to defend their reasoning. It is disheartening to pay for this service through my water bill and have a designated recycling can, only to find it left unemptied. Regardless of its level of occupancy, I believe it should be emptied completely. It is frustrating to have it sit around, solely because they are unwilling to empty it due to their perception of insufficient filling.",

(1) Generally (C) Prohibitions. and 20.04.060 (n) Use of Parking Areas. (5) Storage, Occupancy, or Similar Uses.\n\nWhile the parking and occupancy of the trailer itself raise concerns, my main concern lies with the overall condition of the property. Over the past few months, there has been a noticeable accumulation of debris on the driveway, in bushes, and throughout the yard. This includes items such as tires, biking equipment, and various other objects scattered about, which detract from the character and property values of the neighborhood.\n\nI understand that personal property management is an individual choice, but the current state of the property at 2603 S Bryan St significantly impacts the surrounding environment and creates a less-than-desirable atmosphere for neighbors. I would greatly appreciate it if someone could investigate this matter and take appropriate action.",

These are a wide range of varied vehicles, never the same, coming and going until 4am sometimes.  This is a normally very quiet and subdued neighborhood with a nice mix of owner owned homes and rentals, and a variation of students and retirees and children.  The appearance of this corner venture is unsettling and disruptive of neighborhood life-and I am unaware of any legal venture that operates in this fashion.\nIt would be good if a Bloomington Police car could make occasional trips by this house and through Eastern Heights for a while. Perhaps they will be able to figure out what is going on, or at least discourage what appears to be a common nuisance.\nThank You.",

   "description": "I've noticed all this week that there seems to have been some changes to the timing of the stoplight at the corner of Rogers and Rockport. This has caused 5pm traffic to log jam all the way down Rogers, through the Grimes and Rogers intersection, even backing up to Allen St. or Dixie St. at times. People at the Rogers and Grimes light heading south then attempt to go around the jam by turning left on Rogers onto Grimes. This causes Grimes to back up as well creating further problems at the Grimes and Rogers intersection. The Rogers and Rockport light used to allow traffic to flow without issue, but with the recent change, only 3-5 cars are let through at a time before it's red again. It's turned my 10 minute commute home into a 40-45 minute nightmare. Please help!",

   "description": "I would love to see a proper crosswalk and sidewalks added at all sides of the Rogers and Rockport intersection. I would also like to request a completed sidewalk added to the east side of Rogers between Rockport and the Switchyard Park entrance. Families from Rockport Hills and the surrounding neighborhoods often walk over to Switchyard Park and I personally have had and witnessed numerous close calls attempting to cross Rogers to enter Switchyard Park on foot. It would be great to have some sort of crosswalk added at the Switchyard entrance to aid those on foot trying to cross Rogers and enter the park. During larger events when the park parking lot fills up, there is overflow parking in the field in front of Catalent. Then a huge flow of people are forced to wait for traffic in order to essentially jaywalk into the park. It seems to me that some infrastructure improvements are needed for this area of Rogers St. to facilitate the main entrance to one of the largest parks in the city. Finally, I think it would be great to have some sort of high retaining wall built around the massive eye-sore electrical transfer station directly across from the park entrance (similar to the one built right next to the Upland Woodshop).

   "description": "There is a pine tree on the corner lot at the northwest corner of Hillside and Woodlawn that is leaning dangerously toward Woodlawn. I drive past it a couple of times a week, and it has worsened significantly in the last few weeks. The rootball is visibly pulling up from the ground. I reported this via the CBU phone number a couple of weeks ago, but nothing has been done yet. I'm concerned the recent freeze and impending thaw will cause the tree to topple. Thanks for checking into this.",

   "description": "Hello,\n\nI live at 404 E 1st Street and walk to work at the university. Since it has been raining steadily for days, the leaves have moved into the street gutters and are blocking/clogging the gutters and grated drains all throughout this neighborhood. With the new 2023 leaf recycling law, most of the neighborhood did not rake and remove the leaves (my neighbor at 402 has the front yard filled with leaves, a rental unit) and the recent windy weather has blown the leaves everywhere and now the rain has moved them into the areas that I mentioned. This problem is causing excessive water to gather on my property.\n\nPlease send out crews this week to clean up the leaf problem before there is a major flood in this neighborhood because the forecast is for another 10 days of rain.\n\nThank you,\nELIDA C.

There is activity occurring on the south side of the property closer to W. Gordon Pike that involves what sounds like an excavator with a hydraulic jackhammer attachment endlessly breaking rocks. It went on for 6-10 hours Monday and Tuesday this week, and is continuing today. Is this a short term construction project with an end date, or is the City planning to do this in perpetuity for some reason?",

This week (yesterday) after our Tuesday morning pick-up of trash, I noticed that one of the two attachment points for the lid of our city trash container had broken.  It was not broken before the pick-up.   I understand that the wonderful no-touch process is challenging for the operator, who is working in cold, dark winter streets with large and imprecise equipment, trying to complete a large job in a limited amount of time.   Things break.   I can go to the roll of duct tape to attempt a fix, but I wanted you to be aware of the issue and I'd like to know what you propose as the preferred solution.  \n\nthanks, \nKelly",

Thank you very much.",

Heard there is an incentive for electric vehicle trips but not hybrid vehicles. As well, is it true that carpool trips for dropping off children/dependents at school counts towards this reimbursement? That seems to be an interesting policy choice rewarding individuals with dependents and not prioritizing those dependents instead utilizing school bus transit. Will there be inclusivity and care for employees who make less, don’t have proximity/access to walk or bus into work, and certainly cannot afford an electric vehicle? This policy seems to continue to reward only a select group and has barriers.",

An image from the GIS showing the property owners of record for the parcels and the general area of the camps is attached. The City need not work with any private landowners to clean this up. It is City property being used to make the trail unsafe for everyone. Clear this activity out so it can make the secluded, wooded trail safer for all users. Thanks.",

In one instance I witnessed, I believe this caused a fender-bender accident. In another instance I experienced as a pedestrian crossing, a car made an illegal turn around the median and had to stop right before me. I suggest that there be an extra pylon placed at the ends of the median's yellow lines to disincentivize this erratic driving.",

When the overflow parking is blocked off cars get backed up out to the street waiting for people to leave to take their spot. This creates a huge safety hazard for pedestrians and drivers alike. Could we look into some sort of solution to help reduce this congestion? Perhaps a carpool lot further away? A bus stop? Or even a way to walk from campus safely rather than it being a car required location. If none of those work, could we at least please have the overflow parking always open?",

I am a resident in one of the townhomes nearby. There are traffic signs on my left in the photo that say “No Parking”, but as you can see people from the apartments are parking there still. They are also blocking the fire hydrants as well. This has been an issue before. This issue has almost caused accidents because it being a one car lane. The vehicles parking on the corners of the street are causing blind spots for people to turn onto the street. I’ve have made it aware to Adams Village before but nothing was done. People have also been parking in the alley way between the townhouses (garage side facing west) and the apartment complex off of Samuel Lane causing one lane traffic as well. I hope this is addressed to Adams Village. There seems to be not enough parking for those that live at the Mill apartments. I hope this is addressed and taking care of as this is a parking violation issue.\n\nThanks!",

We have reported this matter to the Urban Forester in August, and they know about the issue, we are on their list. We understand that they have immense workload, however, the urgency of our situation has increased as with each passing windy day, large branches have begun falling into our yard, posing a risk to both property and safety. We fear that the upcoming sub-freezing temperatures and spring tornado season will exacerbate the situation. Therefore, we kindly request that you prioritize the removal of the hazardous trees at your earliest convenience. (We have also started felling hazardous trees within our land.)\n\nYour prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated. Thank you for your understanding and assistance.\n\nKind regards,\nGergo Szanda (765-508-9679, szgergo82@gmail.com)",

   "description": "Re reports #187256 and #187257, these were closed as “city does not maintain county lot”. Okay, but now the Monroe County does not have to abide by city laws when they are located in city limits? This is cause for concern as the excessive dirt and debris cause damage which those laws in place are made to prevent. As well, it also gets washed into the storm system which is a huge concern! So it is okay for the County to have street signage lodged in a stormwater grate right near the southeast corner of the parking lot? This hurts the flow of water and again has impacts on the stormwater system.",

   "description": "Grandview Hills Neighborhood Association report for sewerage on 3617 Post Rd.  \nThis report is on behalf of our neighborhood. \nI have been in contact with Shian'ah Cox at the Health Department regarding a sewer leak on Dec 18, 2023. She came out to take a test. She let me know that the she needed assistance from the Water Utilities to give her access or for them to take the test themselves. As of yesterday Feb 13, 2024 she let me know that she still has not heard back from Water Utilities on steps taken, testing, or results. \nOur neighbor, Bruce Johnson looked back through his emails and notes to offer other timelines to help give some background on what he has been noticing and who he has contacted.  \"I contacted Alex Gray with the City on 9/25/23 and alerted her to the problem on Post Road.  I called her again on 12/5/23.  She told me that she remembered the issue and had taken photos of it on her first visit.  My notes show that I first identified the leak in April when I noticed liquid around the flower pot (fiber optic access).  The problem was caused by the original fibre optic contractors who were first on site in November of 2022.  I have been in contact with ALL of the AEG sub-contractors when they started working in our area again in November of this year.  I have contacted Hoosier Fiber networks field supervisor Luis Medina on at least 3 occasions by calling him on his cell phone.  In addition I have spoken with Russell Lo (AEG supervisor for the work in our area) 2 or more times about this issue. All of the conduit in our neighborhood that was installed in 2022 was abandoned (left in the ground) and all new conduit was pulled in.  None of the subs wanted to repair the problem as they did not cause it.  Russell Lo told me some weeks ago that \"it was repaired\".  Indeed the flower pot was reset when the new conduit was installed--but it rapidly filled up with effluent.  I understand that you have contacted the City Health Department and that they will test the liquid for fecal bacteria.  I have attached photos of the liquid in the flower pot plus the site that I took today.  In addition I took a photo of the abandoned conduit on Post Road to the East of 3617 near the intersection of Meadowlark.  The liquid drains into that abandoned conduit and it has been full for over a year.\n     The street is platted for a width of 40 feet and the flower pot HAS to be on City property.  I have personally witnessed liquid bubbling up and out of the flower pot.  I believe that the residence is using a pump to get the waste water up to the sewer.  Should anyone have further questions they can email me.  Bruce W. Johnson\"\nWe need follow up on this problem. The photos can be shared by email on request.\nThank you, Gillian Field",

   "description": "I boarded your bus #1372 at about 7:22 AM heading East on the #3 route this morning, February 16, 2024.  I noticed the strong presence of diesel exhaust fumes on the bus & notified the driver.  He informed me that that was just the way it is.  I told him that I ood not think that we passengers are supposed to be breathing exhaust fumes.  He said that it is a normal part of the regenerative process.  I explained to him that we are not supposed to be breathing in exhaust fumes.  I asked him if he should radio the issue in to dispatch.  He explained that there was nothing that he could do about it, that it was a normal part of the regenerative process.  When I arrived home & called dispatch, I was told the  same thing.  Tehn when I was still concerned that this was not supposed to be happening, she passed me onto her boss.  I then was also connected to a man in dispatch.  He too told me that it was a normal part of the regenerative process.  I then asked him, so, you are supposed to be breathing in exhaust fumes while on the bus?  Only then did he say that he would have maintenance take a look at it.  However, I have heard this before & they have in the past disregarded this concern & let the bus run with exhaust fumes.\n\nI do not beleive that we tax-paying citizens should have to put up with busses gassing us like we are in a WWII Natzi Contentration camp getting gassed becouse our lives do not matter.  There is never an excuse to expose a passengers to this and in fact, upon being notified by a passenger, the driver should have to pull the bus over, empty the bus of passengers to prevent carbon monoxide poisening & have us wait for a bus replacement or for the issue to get fixed, before reboarding a bus.  I have sent a letter to the EPA about this going on for 20-years as I can recall & treating pasengers this way, as though we should not have an issue with disel-exhaust fumes being inhaled into out lungs while riding as a passenger.",

I went by to take a picture this morning but someone has already poured concrete in the hole I hit last night to fix it. At one point the area I am referring to on the road was completely dug up and had a big piece of metal over it.  Since then it has been filled in with concrete or some other material which continually sinks in or breaks as it was last night when it split my tire.",

   "description": "I regret having to reach out to you regarding this bus #1372.  I boarded this bus on the East route of Route 3 this morning at approximately 7:22 AM on February 19, 2024.  I was informed by Mike Clark of Bloomington Transportation who is the operating manager, that the heater was working on that previous checked bus. Yet the heater is either not on, broken or the driver does not knbow how or desire to turn on the heater for the passenger.  Furhter more, she informed me that the door heater was on, but that they do not work on some of the buses, as was the case on this bus this morning.  There is no need to make passengers suffer like this.  The bus was NOT cold because of opening & closing the doors as MIke Clark previously suggested when I wrote to him regarding this bus.  The heat was simply not coming out of the overhead vents, there was only cold at the vents & the poles for holding onto were cold as well, indicating it had not been on for some time.  The dispatch operator's boss informed me begrudgingly that the bus was in fact bus #1372.  Since the dispatch operator could not be bothered to assist the driver in operating the heater that was alleged to be operating properly according to Mike Clark, I am forced to issue this complaint to the you the City of Bloomington government for heat on the buses in the Winter to be turned on & operating properly for the buses that do not have a heating system functioning or for the bus drivers who feel that we do not need the heat in the Winter.\n\nSincerely,\nTimothy MacKLenzie",

   "description": "We witnessed a gentlemen badly scratch/dent his car today on the concrete block at the overflow entrance while trying to get out of his parking space. There were vehicles parking other vehicles in, vehicles parked along the roadside, and vehicles parked at the exit. In addition all day there seemed to be a line of vehicles waiting to park as well. Might I suggest that there be a shuttle bus from campus to here on the weekends when it is nice, or perhaps a marked trail that is walkable from parking lots further away (the other parking lot was overfull as well), or perhaps have a staff person on site to keep people/property from being damaged due to trying to maneuver in the parking lot.",

   "description": "This evening, March 4, 2024, around 6:11pm, we had 3 male adults ride down the B-Line trail on little motorbikes (not sure what they are technically called). There were 3 individuals. They were at the parking garage off 10th Street before going down the sidewalk to the B-Line, crossing Rogers St. at the trail Cross, and continuing down the B-Line trail towards Fairview St.  I was able to take a quick 5second video of them and I screen grabbed a photo of each rider off of that. I however was only able to upload one photo to the form here.\n\nI'm not sure if they are allowed on the trail but I was thinking they weren't. If they are allowed it seems very dangerous to other trail users. If not allowed on the trail I am wondering if maybe the city could post a reminder on social media and possibly add signs at different points along the trail to remind users as to what is and isn't allowed on the trail. \n\nIf you all want the video clip or the other screen grabbed images I am more than happy to get them to you all.\n\nThanks for keeping our trail safe. It's one of my favorite things about Bloomington!",

The hole is loose and getting larger. It seems it is related to some utility that may be buried beside the road, and it is VERY close to a marked gas line. There is another sinking spot on the corner of Kerry and Grandview, but it is low and muddy and not open like the other spot.

This photo was from yesterday‘s mild rain. At times the water is much deeper and standing longer because the drain is clogged. A larger drain needs to be installed or possibly an additional drain as well, further up the road. This may be leading to erosion of soil and possibly foundation issues and needs to be addressed soon. We are also due to have our road paved this year so the drainage would need to be fixed prior to that. Please advise.",

   "description": "The debris dam on the creek below the bridge between Sherwood Oaks Park and Olcott Park has become even more effective.  The water level at the bridge is visibly higher, and so much water is now being held back that there is a waterfall over one end of the dam.  There has been more erosion of the flat land along the creek at the base of the trail through Olcott Woods.  It is likely that the abundance of leaves in the creek this winter (from people disposing of leaves in the creek?) has made the dam more effective.",

The sidewalk ends here, so people have to cross the street to get to the bus stop, gas station, or grocery store. There have been a few times where people have been crossing the street at night in dark colors and it has been impossible to see them until you have just enough time to brake. I think a street light or a crossing light is necessary to prevent a pedestrian incident in the future.",

   "description": "I work for affordable fence ad last winter there was a deck being built at 2622 e spice wood crt. I noticed that the support beams were being set up using 4x4 posts. I told them at the time that I believed that 4x6 posts were as small as code allowed. The contractor scoffed at me and i just said \"ok\" and went back to work. Yesterday while doing an inspection on the fence I installed I saw that two elderly people live at the home and we're out on their deck. The deck (with them on the deck) was very rickety and moved way too much to be safe. I hate to see anyone getting one over on e elderly simply because they can. Their safety is a major issue and I can no longer be silent about the issue. Hopefully you can look into it promptly thank you!\n\nAnonymous",

This height difference can be dangerous for westbound cyclists riding on the sidewalk who need to negotiate both a quick right turn and a left turn to enter the SR46 underpass. Now that an asphalt multi-use path has been built at Relato Bloomington at the intersection of Pete Ellis Drive and Longview Avenue, westbound cyclists are more apt to ride on the path/sidewalk vs. the street, and will continue to ride on the sidewalk all the way to the underpass. Cyclists will be going at speed since it is downhill westbound. To negotiate this sidewalk height disparity, while at the same time negotiating a sweeping turn, poses a dangerous situation that can be easily eliminated.",

Several people have complained to front desk personnel, asking them to tell the players to turn the music down, which can be heard everywhere on the main floor of the facility.  Unfortunately, no TLRC facility staff members have been able to do anything about this issue.  Children are subjected to songs which include the words \"f*ck\" \"rape\" \"n*gger\" etc.  Because nothing had been done about it by the staff, someone approached a member of the basketball group and politely asked them if they could turn the music down.  A member of the group verbally assaulted and intimidated the person causing the person to leave the facility because they were so upset and felt threatened by the response of the basketball player.  I would like to ask if a rule could be added to the facility that no one is to play personal music that can be heard by others while inside the TLRC.  Thank you for your consideration of this request.  I have been a member for several years and know people who use the TLRC frequently. When I am there on Saturdays, many people complain but no one says anything for fear of retaliation or lack of action by staff.  Thank you very much for your consideration of our request.",

Biking in this lane feels so much safer and more comfortable with the barriers up, especially since considering drivers tend to go pretty fast on this road. Also, the barriers don't look like an eyesore at all, which is something I previously read that IU officials were concerned about. The barriers blend into the background enough to not be garish, but they are still clearly visible to drivers and cyclists. Honestly they're pretty stylish for bicycle lane barriers. As a bicycle commuter, even small-scale projects like this make me feel cared about by the city. It makes me glad to be a Bloomingtonian! Laissez le B-Town rouler!",

Anyways in short the male trees (from what I have read) are wind-blown pollen versus insect-transmitted for female.  Short of it, is that all male trees is causing a big increase in suffering among those such as myself with tree pollen allergies.\n\nSo please do more fruit trees/female trees.  Plus fruit/food producing trees are just so much more awesome for a community.\n\nApparently it's called botanical sexism amongst urban planners and it is increasingly recognized as a big problem.  We NEED more female trees to remove pollen from the air; I could hardly breathe today.\n\nThank you for considering diversifying the sex of Bloomington trees.  I am hopeful we already are focusing on mixed or exclusively female trees and not falling into the trap of botanical sexism of male only.",

My car did not have any scratch on the back bumper. I picked it up this morning Friday March 29, 2024, and I noticed that my car's back bumper was scratched. The person who scratched it was honest and left a note on my front windshield. I tried reaching out to the person today Friday March 29, 2024 and this person has not reached back to me. I have a picture of the note and the damage to my car. I know that the garage has cameras. My car was packed on the 3rd floor closer to the elevators. Are you able to check the cameras to identify the person who damaged the back bumper of my car. I am attaching the note from the person apologizing for the accident plus the damage to my back bumper. I will like my car fixed and I will appreciate any help the 4th Street garage team can offer to get this resolved.",

A little bit later, passing by again, there were homeless people unloading items from the car it appeared. This car would have had to drive on the multi-use path along Gordon Pike to get onto the gravel road. As of 8am 3/30/24, the vehicle is still parked at the homeless camp. The City needs to do something about these camps. There are gasoline powered bikes traveling the Rail Trail and gravel road with little regard for pedestrians, tons of trash from Gordon Pike to Country Club Drive, and now free parking at the camp sites. The problems started when the homeless moved south and it is getting worse by the week. This is on City-owned property. This makes the Rail Trail less safe for everyone. Clear the camps out. The City needs to take action before someone is seriously hurt by the growing problem the City allows to fester. It is only a matter of time.",

   "description": "I live in Hoosier Court Apartments and my window faces the apartment complex across the street. I have seen tenants of the apartment on the bottom level throw their dogs out of the window to use the bathroom, rather than taking them outside. They will dump the dog, and then scream at them to hurry up. If the dog is just sitting there, they get pretty violent. They will scream some more. If a dog is not listening, the husband/dad will come out and smack the dog. All of them yell viciously at these animals. I’ve seen five different dogs be thrown out the window. I also have seen a cat. On top of them screaming and hitting their dogs, it is worrisome that they can’t even take the effort to take the dogs outside, so it is doubtful they are taking much care of them at all. It is the first floor, 2nd apartment from the right in the photo. If needed, I can provide footage of the next time they throw the dogs out.",
